 * Since Wonder is a task management suite for DAO's, not every user will be a dev.

 * to manipulate, update, modify Source Control tasks to better organize and keep
 * track of the work required to launch their project.
 *
 * As an example, consider Wonder, itself a DAO. It is utilizing a task labelling
 * strategy to incentivize and reward its contributors. Instead of requiring the
 * project manager to create a GitHub account, navigate to GitHub, learn GitHub's
 * interface
